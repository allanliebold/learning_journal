# LJ Code 301
### Day 11

We learned about routing for single page applications. This is one of those days where I mostly just follow along, but I'll need to go over everything again until I really absorb the information. I'll also need to go back over the higher order functions from Friday. Finishing up the pair programming assignment did help me understand those concepts a lot better, but I still need to work them into my portfolio.
