LJ Code 201 - Day 1

I'm feeling very optimistic about this class and learning how to code in general. What stood out to me the most on the first day of class was how often we were told this is going to get difficult, confusing, and overwhelming. I found that oddly reassuring, knowing that if/when I find myself struggling with the material I won't be alone.

So far I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the concepts we've covered these first two days. I'm still getting used to the terminal and git. I mostly understand what CSS does, but I'm not really sure what exactly to do with it to use it effectively. I'm hoping we go over that some more soon. I'm really enjoying messing around with javascript and I'm looking forward to what we'll do with it as the class goes on.
