# LJ Code 201
### Day 13

We were introduced to local storage today, which seems like a pretty big step forward. I got my app saving what I wanted and I mostly follow what the code is doing. But I'll definitely need to go over it and try practicing these concepts until I really feel comfortable with them. 

List!:

- I think I need to start using function returns more.
- And also prototype methods.
- And split up my functions instead of cramming so many things into a few giant functions.
