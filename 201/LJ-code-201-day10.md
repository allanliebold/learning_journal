# LJ Code 201
### Day 10

Today was mainly a recap day. The assignment is a chance to get some good practice with CSS styling, which I think is still one of my weak spots. I've managed to get the top banner of the Chocolate Pizza page to look almost right-ish. I plan to spend the morning tomorrow working on it. I'd also like to just build a bunch of web pages just as an exercise. There are some assignments from this past week I need to go back through too.

My goals for this weekend:
- Get the Chocolate Pizza page looking good by Sunday night, even though it's due Monday night.
- Fix everything I need to in my assignments and re-submit them.
- Code for fun and practice. I've got an idea for a game kind of project, like Brian was talking about. Not a fighting game or anything too complex, but I think it's doable at my skill level. Couldn't hurt to try anyway.
