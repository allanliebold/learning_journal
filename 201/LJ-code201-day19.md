# LJ Code 201
### Day 19

We're all set for presenting tomorrow. I'm not the biggest fan of public speaking, but I think it'll go fine. Besides our personal introductions I get to walk through the personality quiz, which is pretty self-explanatory and should be amusing for the audience.

- I need to take a look at the 301 pre-work. After celebrating the end of 201.
- I'm told I also should check out Codewars.
