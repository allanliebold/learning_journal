# LJ Code 201
### Day 18

Project week has been very different from the rest of the class. We're setting our own goals and working towards them. I've had to do a lot more research to figure out how to do things, since we're not just following defined instructions like the previous assignments. I also had a whiteboarding session with Brian, which I enjoyed. I was actually surprised that I knew the syntax he asked for off the top of my head.

Things I'm learning about:
- I made a switch statement. I remember seeing that on Codecademy, but it didn't come up in class.
- Map objects. I haven't quite figured out how to use them, but I looked through the documentation about them.
- Getting a better grasp on event listeners and dom manipulation stuff. Or at least I think I am and then I mess something up and have to figure out what went wrong. Rinse, repeat.
