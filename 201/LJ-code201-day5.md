# LJ Code 201
### Day 5

I'm excited to apply what we learned in the CSS exercise today to my About Me page. I've been having trouble with position parts of a page and now I have a much better idea of how everything fits together. I'd like to play around on Codepen for a while to get practice and more ideas of how to design a page layout. I may redesign my About Me page from scratch with these concepts in mind.

I learned a lot about functions, especially how variables can be passed in and out and how that relates the concept of scope. I really got into using the console to test out code, and using console.logs to narrow down problems I was having.

This weekend I plan to:
- Work on my About Me page and deploy it by Sunday night
- Review my assignments from this week and see where they could be improved, especially Friday's
- Check out some other people's code on GitHub and Codepen
- Maybe rest a little
