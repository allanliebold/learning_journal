# LJ Code 201
### Day 20

Presentations went really well and there was some celebrating afterward. I feel good about how our project went and the course overall. It's nice to have a little of the pressure of class temporarily lifted, but I know I'll have to get right back in it soon enough.

This weekend and next week I will:
- Install Linux on my laptop.
- Do all of the 301 course work
- Add some features to my side project
- Enjoy some time off and visit my family
