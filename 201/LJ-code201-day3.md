# LJ Code 201
### Day 3

Today was a very full day.

Spending so much time going over git has made me feel a lot more comfortable with all the steps of ACP.

I really like Codepen, which I had been introduced to before but didn't really spend much time with. I can see it being a very useful tool going forward.  

Other things we went over in class today:
- For Loops
- While Loops
- The CSS Box Model

The assignment was very involving and the hours after lunch flew by. I definitely learned a lot about loops by making many, many mistakes and figuring out how to fix them. At times it was frustrating but there were plenty of eureka moments too. If this is only Day 3, I can't wait to see how much I'll have learned and figured out by the end of Code 201 and into the next classes.
