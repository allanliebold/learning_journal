# LJ Code 201
### Day 15

Today we recapped everything we've learned in class. It's surreal looking back and remembering the first few days. It wasn't that long ago but it feels like it... but it also feels like it's gone by fast. And it feels like we've learned a crazy amount of stuff in this short span of time, while also feeling like we've barely scratched the surface.

This weekend:
- Go over and resubmit a few assignments.
- Practice stuff! I kind of wish we had a week to just drill some of the concepts, like doing a few design comps. I want to try to do that in the break between 201 and 301, but I'll be visiting my family too. I'll just have to find the time.
- Some preliminary project research.
- Rest...?
