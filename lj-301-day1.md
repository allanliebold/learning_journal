# LJ Code 301
### Day 1

First day of 301! A lot of it was review of what we learned in 201 and it was nice to get a bit of a refresher. The structure of the class is very different from 201. Pair programming went well, I think. The most important thing we learned was probably @media in css, which lets us have styles that change based on certain conditions. Since we're focusing on mobile first and responsive pages it's definitely going to be important to get a handle on that.
