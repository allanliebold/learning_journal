# LJ Code 201
### Day 6

We were introduced to the concept of objects today. They already sounded pretty useful right away, but once we started really diving into it the possibilities kind of made my head spin. In a good way. Brian stressed that understanding the whole concept of objects is the single most important thing in Javascript and I think I'm at least headed in the right direction towards understanding why.

I genuinely enjoyed working out how to complete today's assignment. There were frustrating moments, which is pretty typical already by this point, but it was like solving a puzzle. I was absolutely elated when I saw the lists appear on screen the way I wanted them to.

Things I need to work on still:

- CSS. Getting there, but I need more practice
- Pull requests and merging on GitHub
- Including useful comments throughout my code
