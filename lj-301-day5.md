# LJ Code 301
### Day 5

The Google event was very cool. I'm really glad I managed to get a ticket, and I hope to go to more events like this in the future. It was interesting to hear from the engineers and interns, and there was also a Code Fellows alum who spoke briefly.

I worked on a lot of Code Wars katas. They get tricky really quickly. The most useful part I think is going through the other answers and discussions afterward. I've learned a few things from that. I picked up a few regex concepts that way. I also did the regex tutorial bonus assignment. I wanted to do more but it wants you to pay for a subscription after the first lesson.

What I need to do now is go over the lab demo some more. Still trying to wrap my head around it. I also need to work on my portfolio. I've got some ideas for what I'd like to do with it.
