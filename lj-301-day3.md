# LJ Code 301
### Day 3

Pair programming was definitely trickier than the first two days, but it felt like we learned a lot. I also liked the to-do list and color picker during lecture. We walked through making a similar to-do list in 201, but this seemed to be a lot easier to make with jQuery. With the color picker I think I'm starting to understand how and why to use data attributes, which also came up in the lab assignment.

Things I need to work on:
- My portfolio in general, but especially my css
- Code Wars. I've signed up but haven't done much in it yet.
- The bonus assignments. I'll probably do some of those on Saturday though.
