# LJ Code 201
### Day 8

Today I found out a lot of what I did yesterday was kind of wrong and way more difficult than necessary. I have a feeling I could probably copy and paste that to a lot of these and it would be true. But that's a lot less frustrating than it sounds.

The main lesson was about forms. It was pretty cool to finally be programming a script that takes inputs and does things with it.

Things of note:

- Always credit sources if you incorporate someone else's code into your own. Which reminds me, I just copied Brian's styling for the table assignment. Actually, I want to go back in and change the styling to something else.
- Never put Dreamweaver on a resume
