# LJ Code 301
### Day 6

Today was all about Ajax and JSON. We were already been introduced to JSON in 201, so I have a pretty good handle on that. I think I'm getting Ajax, and the demonstration with Pokeapi was cool. But I'll need to use it more before I feel comfortable with it.

Pair programming went smoothly, so I've got some extra time to work on classwork and my portfolio. I really need to take the time to make the page look good. I've got a pretty specific idea for how to make it more my own and personalized, but I may need to build something from the ground up.
