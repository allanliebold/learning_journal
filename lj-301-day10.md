# LJ Code 301
### Day 10

My 1 on 1 with Brian went well. We mainly talked about how this past week has been pretty heavy with new concepts to learn. Even just on Friday we were introduced to functional programming in lecture, which is a big subject on its own. I think I understand .map and at least to some degree .reduce. I'll definitely have to do that bonus assignment and probably look up some other resources about those things.
