# LJ Code 301
### Day 15

I spent the weekend creating my portfolio over again from scratch. It's missing a lot of components but I like how it looks a lot more now. I also looked into the api for our project. We're hoping to get a lot done today and we'll probably meet up tomorrow to do more work on it. Our goal is to have the very basic mvp done by Wednesday.
