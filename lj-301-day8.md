# LJ Code 301
### Day 8

The SQL tutorials were kind of fun. It's easy to read the statements and just know what they're supposed to do.

The lab was very different than what we've been doing. We just had to go over the concepts from class to answer questions about the code. I'm still not 100% confident in my understanding of Node, so I was glad when Brian said we'd be going over it again in the next lecture.
