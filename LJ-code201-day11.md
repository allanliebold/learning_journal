# LJ Code 201
### Day 11

Today's lecture was about embedding video and audio files on a page. For the assignment though, I had to review appending HTML with javascript and using objects and arrays. I also went to my first meetup, which was fun. They had free food and drinks and it was a good place to work on the assignment. There's no meetup next Monday, but I'm planning to attend this one and hopefully some others regularly.

Things!:

- Don't us <hr>s or <br>s... I did use a <br> on my Chocolate Pizza page. But I won't do it again.
- I need to come up with a project idea to pitch. I sort of have one, but I don't know if it's very compelling.
- User stories are kind of difficult to come up with. But I need to write a few more.
