# LJ Code 301
### Day 13

We went over Heroku and how to deploy an app. The whole setup process went pretty smoothly for me. I successfully got my portfolio up and running... well, mostly. The repo data isn't populating to the page. Also, in general I need to fix a lot of my portfolio and polish it. I've been meaning to add something like a carousel for navigation, and I need to fill in the About Me info. It's all pretty bare bones right now. Hopefully I'll have time today and tomorrow to work on those things.
